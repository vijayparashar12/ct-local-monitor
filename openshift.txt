#Deploying to openshift

Step 1. clone the repo form github with below command.

    git clone https://github.com/vijayparashar12/ct-local-monitor.git

Step 2. Add new remote location to repo.

    git remote add openshift ssh://57497a2389f5cf2cdc000110@ctlocalmonitor-vijayparashar12.rhcloud.com/~/git/ctlocalmonitor.git/

Step 3. Verify the remote is added

    git remote -v
    openshift	ssh://57497a2389f5cf2cdc000110@ctlocalmonitor-vijayparashar12.rhcloud.com/~/git/ctlocalmonitor.git/ (fetch)
    openshift	ssh://57497a2389f5cf2cdc000110@ctlocalmonitor-vijayparashar12.rhcloud.com/~/git/ctlocalmonitor.git/ (push)
    origin	https://github.com/vijayparashar12/ct-local-monitor.git (fetch)
    origin	https://github.com/vijayparashar12/ct-local-monitor.git (push)

Step 4. Push master to openshift

    git push openshift master

Step 4.1 once openshift is added as remote, you can always deploy using 

    git push openshift master

Step 5. Push your changes to origin master as well.
